    <p>Until now, sla reporting had 4 ways to set the hosts/services of the
       report: hostnames, hostgroups, servicegroups and services. This turned
       out to be to unflexible.
    </p>
    <p>
       So now you can use all the full filtering possibilities from the status
       pages for reports as well.

    </p>
    <p>
       In addition to that, it is now possible to select whether the report should
       contain only hosts or services or both.

    <p>Before LMD existed, Thruk used so called state hosts to predict the
       connectivity of its backends. This solution had some flaws and
       LMD works quite well for improving performance and availability, especially
       with bad or slow network conditions or when having lots of backends.
       LMD is the prefered solution.
