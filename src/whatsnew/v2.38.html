  </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>Thruk now threads the cgi.cfg like a normal configuration file. So
      anything which could have been set in the cgi.cfg can now be configured
      in the thruk_local.conf as well and vice versa.

      This allows personalized configuration snippets for example like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
refresh_rate=90
&lt;User dashboard_user&gt;
    refresh_rate=30
&lt;/User&gt;
    </pre>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-12">
    <h3 class="page-header">Logcache Update</h3>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>Thruk got a new logcache which performs way better. The idea of the
      logcache is to put log data into a sql database so Thruk does not
      have to request the logs for reports from livestatus over and over.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are 2 range buckets now. A shorter range (10weeks by default) which
      stores all log entries and a longer range (2 years by default) which only
      stores sla relevant entries. Doing this, we could remove the deduplication
      which didn't help as much as expected and made things slower and more complicated
      then neccessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new version does take better use of the time and host index so queries
      should be much faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      The database scheme has changed, so a new import is required. If it is not
      done automatically, you can run the import like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
      %> thruk logcache import --start=-1y
    </pre>
    <p>
      This will import the last years logfiles into the database.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, a logcache details page has been added to get more insights about
      the cache itself, linked from the performance page.

    <p>Previously reports could either be made public read-only or not. The latest
      release adds more fine granular permissions and lets you choose to add
      read-only or read-write permissions to specific users and groups.
